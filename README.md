# Neural Network Image Reconstruction

This project demonstrates a simple neural network (NN) implementation for image reconstruction using the SDL2 library for visualization. The neural network is implemented in C, and the project relies on the stb_image and stb_image_write libraries for image loading and saving.

# Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

* SDL2
* stb_image
* stb_image_write

# Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

> git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo

2. Build the project using your preferred C compiler:
> gcc -o image_reconstruction main.c nn1.c -lm -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image

3. Run the executable:
> ./image_reconstruction

# Notes
The neural network is a simple implementation for educational purposes and may not be suitable for production use.
Adjustments and enhancements can be made to improve the performance and functionality of the neural network.
Feel free to explore and modify the code according to your requirements. Happy coding!
